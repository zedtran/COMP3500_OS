This repository contains files and subdirectories related to course content for COMP3500. Course Description: Structure and functions of operating systems; processes and process scheduling; synchronization and mutual exclusion; memory management; auxiliary storage management; resource allocation and deadlock; security, privacy, and ethical concerns; design tradeoffs. See [AU CSSE BULLETIN](http://bulletin.auburn.edu/coursesofinstruction/comp/) for additional information.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the directory/projects up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

Command Line Developer Tools that will allow you to utilize a clang compiler such as gcc. PC users need to have Visual Studio and related Visual C++ build tools. MacOS Users can open terminal and check if Xcode developer tools are already installed by entering the following prompt in the terminal command line:
```
$ xcode-select -p
```
If you see:
```
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```
the full Xcode package is already installed. Further, MacOS Sierra will alert you when you enter a command in the terminal that requires Xcode Command Line Tools. Try ```$ gcc ``` or ```$ make ```.
