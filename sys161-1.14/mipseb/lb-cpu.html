<h3>Summary</h3>

<ul>
<li> Physical RAM (up to 508 megabytes) starts at physical address 0.
<li> The LAMEbus device mapping area is from physical address
     0x1fe00000 to 0x1fffffff.
<li> The LAMEbus device mapping area appears at kernel virtual
     addresses 0xbfe00000 to 0xbfffffff without requiring any
     kernel setup.
<li> Kernels should be linked to be loaded starting at or (generally)
     closely above virtual address 0x80000000.

<h3>Details</h3>

The MIPS processor defines four hardwired segments in its virtual
address space. It also defines five hardwired addresses that it will
jump to at various times. These are listed in the table above.
<p>

The segments are:
<blockquote>
<table width=95% border=0>
<tr><th width=10% align=left>Name</th><th align=left>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>kseg2</td><td>Supervisor mode only; TLB-mapped, cacheable</td></tr>
<tr><td>kseg1</td><td>Supervisor mode only; direct-mapped, uncached</td></tr>
<tr><td>kseg0</td><td>Supervisor mode only; direct-mapped, cached</td></tr>
<tr><td>kuseg</td><td>User and supervisor mode; TLB-mapped, cacheable</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

The mapped segments are mapped via a translation lookaside buffer
(TLB) with software refill. The direct-mapped segments are mapped
(without use of the TLB) both to the first 512 megabytes of the 
physical memory space.
<p>

Three of the hardwired addresses (the ones used for system
initialization) are 4 MB below the top of kseg1. The other two are at the
bottom of kseg0. This means that, of the first 512 megabytes of
physical memory space, at least part of the top 4M must be ROM, and the very
bottom must be RAM. This was clearly designed in an era
where 512 megs of memory was an unthinkably large amount.
<p>

We put the first 508 megs of physical RAM starting at physical address
0. After this we reserve 2 megabytes for a boot ROM; after that we
put the 2-megabyte LAMEbus mapping area. Then physical RAM
resumes again at the 512-meg mark. Thus, if the RAMSZ register reports
512 megs of RAM, it will appear from 0x0 to 0x1fbfffff and then from
0x20000000 to 0x203fffff.
<p>

(Note that the current implementation will not let you configure
anywhere near 512 megs of physical RAM, and does not actually have a
boot ROM, just 2 megs of empty space. If you get an exception before
switching off the "bootstrap" flag, the system will hang trying to
execute from nonexistent memory. This is suboptimal and may be
corrected in a future release.)
<p>

As a result of all this, the best place to load a kernel is starting
at 0x80001000, the first page after the page containing the hardwired
exception addresses. Because of the way ELF executables work and
because of the way linkers work, trying to create a kernel image to
load at 0x80000000 that has the exception entry points in exactly the
right place is highly impractical. The best bet is to write
position-independent code for the entry points and copy it into place
during kernel initialization.
<p>

Note that System/161 does not implement a cache simulator; all memory
accesses go straight through to memory. This is important, because the
MIPS architecture does not guarantee synchronization between the
instruction and data caches. On a real MIPS, after performing any
operation that involves writing code to memory and then executing it
later, one must manually flush the instruction cache. This is painful
to implement. If you are only running on System/161 and never intend
to run on a real MIPS, you can avoid actually implementing this code,
though you should stub it out and insert calls to it in the necessary
places in case you change your mind later.
<p>

This is also a concern for hardware devices that may do DMA into
cached regions of memory. However, LAMEbus devices do not do DMA
(instead they have memory-mapped buffers) and the LAMEbus mapping area
is meant to be accessed through the uncached hardwired segment. It
also appears in the cached hardwired segment, but as cached memory
access is worse than useless for device registers, this area should
not be used.
<p>

Kernel loading on MIPS takes place exactly as described for the
general case. Assuming the kernel is linked to run at 0x80001000, it
will be loaded into physical memory starting at 0x00001000 (which
appears at virtual address 0x80001000) and control will be transferred
to the kernel's entry point in virtual memory as recorded by the
linker.
<p>

The kernel arguments are assembled into a single null-terminated
string which is stored at the top of physical memory. The address of
this string is passed in the first argument register (a0, register 4).
The stack pointer is initialized to point near the top of physical
memory, so it can be used (growing down as normal) for scratch space
during kernel initialization if necessary.
<p>

Because the MIPS has a 32-bit memory bus, all registers (all LAMEbus
device registers are 32-bit) can be read or written atomically in a
single instruction.
