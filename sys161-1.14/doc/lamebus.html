<h3>LAMEbus</h3>

LAMEbus is a simple no-fuss 32-bit system bus and bus controller.
There are 32 slots, each of which has a fixed 64k addressable region.
These regions are mapped in order into the system physical memory
space. Thus the physical address for the start of the region for slot
N can be computed as LAMEBASE+0x10000*N, where LAMEBASE is the physical
base address of the LAMEbus mapping area.
<p>

Depending on the processor type in use, this area may appear
automatically at some other address in virtual memory, or may need to
be mapped into kernel virtual memory using the MMU. For more
information, <A HREF=lb-cpu.html>click here</A>.
<p>

The last slot, slot 31, is always occupied by the bus controller
card. Its mapped memory area is divided into two parts. The upper half
(32k) is reserved for mapping a boot ROM, which has no published entry
points, supplies no services besides system startup, and may or may
not actually be present. The lower half (also 32k) is split into 32 1k
regions, each of which maps configuration data about its corresponding
slot. The last such region refers to the bus controller card itself,
and has some additional registers.
<p>

The physical address of the config region for slot N can be computed
as LAMEBASE+(0x10000*31)+(0x400*N). Again, the virtual address depends
on the processor type.
<p>

Each of these config regions contains the following fields:
<blockquote>
<table width=100% border=0>
<tr><th width=10%>Name</th><th width=10%>Offset</th>
				<th align=left>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>VID</td><td>0x00-0x03</td>	<td>Vendor ID of device</td></tr>
<tr><td>DID</td><td>0x04-0x07</td>	<td>Device type ID</td></tr>
<tr><td>DRL</td><td>0x08-0x0b</td>	<td>Device revision level</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>0x0c-0x3ff</td>	<td>Reserved</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>

Vendor IDs defined are as follows:
<p>
<blockquote>
<table width=100% border=0>
<tr><th width=10%>Value</th>	<th align=left>Organization</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td>			<td>No card present</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td>			<td>CS161 Course Staff</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
If no card is present, the other fields in the region may contain
invalid values, and references to that slot's mapping area will
(normally) cause memory bus errors. 
<p>
The device type IDs and revision levels are defined by the vendors.
<p>

Offsets 512-1023 (0x200-0x3ff) of the bus controller's own
configuration region are mapped to the bus controller's own
registers. For the CS161 revision 1 bus controller (VID 1, DID 1, DRL
1) these registers are:

<blockquote>
<table width=100% border=0>
<tr><th width=10%>Name</th><th width=10%>Offset</th>
				<th align=left>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>RAMSZ</td><td>0x200-0x203</td>
				<td>Size of physical RAM in bytes</td></tr>
<tr><td>IRQS</td><td>0x204-0x207</td>
			<td>Mask of slots presently interrupting</td></tr>
<tr><td>PWR</td><td>0x208-0x20b</td>
			<td>Power enable register</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>0x20c-0x3ff</td><td>Reserved</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

RAMSZ reports the system main board configuration. Writes are
rejected. Where the physical RAM appears in the physical address
space, and whether it's contiguous (and if not, where the gaps are)
depends on the processor type.
<p>

The IRQS register holds a 1 for each slot that is presently asserting
its IRQ line. Writes to IRQS are rejected; interrupts should be
cleared on the devices generating them. Bit 0 represents slot 0,
etc. Thus bit 31 is the bus controller's bit.
<p>

The PWR register switches the system off if the magic value 0xfee1dead
is written into it. Other writes have no effect, and reading produces
undefined results.
