<h2>System/161</h2>

System/161 is a synthetic (read: made up) hardware platform designed
specifically for use in CS161. It includes a simulated system bus and
bus devices, and any of several possible simulated CPUs.

<h3>Getting System/161</h3>

If you are working on the Science Center ICE machines and have the
CS161 binary directory <tt>~lib161/usr/bin</tt> on your path, you can
run the version of System/161 installed by the course staff just by
typing <tt>sys161</tt> or <tt>trace161</tt>. You only need download
and compile it yourself if you want to work elsewhere.
<p>

The source distribution for System/161 can be found on the CS161 web
site, <A HREF=http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/~cs161>here</A>. It
supports most Unix-like systems. Windows is not supported. (However,
you might be able to compile it with cygwin or a similar toolset. If
you do this, you're on your own.)
<p>

All you need is sys161-1.0.tar.gz (or whatever the current version
is).
<p>

<h3>Building System/161</h3>

Unpack the distribution file by typing
<pre>
	tar -xvzf sys161-1.0.tar.gz
</pre>
(substitute whatever version you have for the 1.0.)
<p>

This will create a subdirectory called <tt>sys161-1.0</tt> with the
files in it. Go into this directory by typing
<pre>
	cd sys161-1.0
</pre>
(substitute whatever version you have for the 1.0.)
<p>

Now you need to know what processor type you want to use. For CS161
this year, you want the "mipseb" processor. For other uses, consult
the course staff, or choose from the list of supported processors,
which you can get by running <tt>./configure --help</tt>.
<p>

Run the configure script. Specify the processor type you want as an
argument. In the simple case, it looks like this:
<pre>
	./configure mipseb
</pre>
It'll grind for a while. If you want it to install the resulting programs
someplace other than <tt>~/cs161/root</tt>, pass configure the
<tt>--installdir</tt> option, like this:
<pre>
	./configure --installdir=$HOME/bin
</pre>
Note that, because of the way the Unix shell handles ~, if you use
<tt>~/bin</tt> instead of <tt>$HOME/bin</tt> it won't work.
<p>

Now compile things by typing
<pre>
	make
</pre>
and install them by typing
<pre>
	make install
</pre>

This compiles and installs two programs: <tt>sys161</tt>, the normal
or "fast" simulator, and <tt>trace161</tt>, which has lots of
debugging and diagnostic support built in and thus doesn't run as
quickly. You can run OS/161 in either.
<p>

If the compilation bombs, contact the course staff.
<p>

System/161 has been tested on the following platforms:
<ul>
<li> NetBSD on x86
<li> Digital Unix 4.0x on alpha
</ul>

<hr>
<A NAME=running>

<h3>Running System/161</h3>

There are two versions of System/161 that can be built: the normal
one, <tt>sys161</tt>, and one compiled to be able to log information
about what's happening and generally assist debugging, which is called
<tt>trace161</tt>.
<p>

The general format for the command line for either of these is like
this:
<blockquote>
	<tt>sys161</tt> [ <em>System/161 options</em> ] 
		<em>kernel</em> [ <em>kernel options</em> ]
</blockquote>
<p>

The <em>System/161 options</em> are:
<blockquote>
<dl>

<dt>-c <em>configfile</em></dt>
<dd>Specify alternate config file. Default is <tt>sys161.conf</tt>.</dd>

<dt>-p <em>port</em></dt>
<dd>Listen for debugger connections on specified TCP port. The default
is to use the Unix-domain socket <tt>./.sockets/gdb</tt> for debugger
connections. 
<br><font size=-1><strong>Note: because the remote gdb protocol
does not support authentication, use this option only with
caution.</strong></font></dd>

<dt>-s</dt>
<dd>Pass signal-generating characters (^C, ^Z, etc.) through to the
kernel instead of treating them as requests to sys161.</dd>

<dt>-w</dt>
<dd>Wait for a debugger connection immediately on startup.</dd>

</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>

The following additional options control trace161's tracing and are
ignored by sys161:
<blockquote>
<dl>

<dt>-f <em>tracefile</em></dt>
<dd>Set the file trace information is logged to. By default, stderr is
used. Specifying -f- sends output to stdout instead of stderr.</dd>

<dt>-t <em>traceflags</em></dt>
<dd>Tell System/161 what to trace. The following flags are available:
   <table>
   <tr><td>d</td>	<td>Trace disk I/O</td></tr>
   <tr><td>e</td>	<td>Trace emufs I/O</td></tr>
   <tr><td>j</td>	<td>Trace jumps and branches</td></tr>
   <tr><td>k</td>	<td>Trace instructions in kernel mode</td></tr>
   <tr><td>n</td>	<td>Trace network I/O</td></tr>
   <tr><td>t</td>	<td>Trace TLB/MMU activity</td></tr>
   <tr><td>u</td>	<td>Trace instructions in user mode</td></tr>
   <tr><td>x</td>	<td>Trace exceptions</td></tr>
   </table>
   Caution: tracing instructions generates huge amounts of output
   that may overwhelm smaller host systems.
</dd>

</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>

The following option is also only available in trace161:
<blockquote>
<dl>

<dt>-P</dt>
<dd>Collect a kernel profile and leave it in the file
<tt>gmon.out</tt> for analysis by <tt>gprof</tt>.</dd>

</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>

The <em>kernel</em> is an operating system kernel to load and run. It
should be an ELF-format executable for the same processor type as
System/161 is compiled to support. For further information, see below.
<p>

Note that options found after the kernel name will be passed to the
kernel and not interpreted by System/161.
<p>

<hr>
<A NAME=config>

<h3>System/161 Config Files</h3>

System/161 reads a config file to determine what hardware it should
simulate. The default config file is <tt>./sys161.conf</tt>. A
different one can be specified with the <em>-c</em> option.
<p>

The config file is composed of lines in the following form:
<blockquote>
<em>slot-number</em> <em>device-name</em> [<em>args</em>...]
</blockquote>
<p>

Slots may be 0-31. You must place the bus controller card in slot 31,
or the system will not run.
<p>

Single-line comments are introduced with <tt>#</tt>.
<p>

The devices available, and the arguments they support, are:

<h3>Kernel Debugging with <tt>gdb</tt></h3>

System/161 supports remote <tt>gdb</tt> debugging directly into the
simulator. The simulator acts like an in-circuit emulator (ICE), only
more so, so that you can debug without any interference whatsoever
with the debugged code - even timing is unaffected.
<p>

To do this, you need a copy of <tt>gdb</tt> compiled for the same
processor that System/161 is simulating, and that understands the
ELF kernel file format loaded by System/161. Get and compile
<A HREF=http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/~cs161/download>the CS161
toolchain</A>.
On the Science Center machines, you can just run <tt>cs161-gdb</tt>.
<p>

Run gdb as you normally would:
<pre>
	gdb kernel
</pre>

After it finishes loading, attach to System/161 by typing this into gdb:
<pre>
	target remote unix:.sockets/gdb
</pre>
and gdb will connect up to the copy of System/161 you have running in
the same directory and you can start debugging. (You can debug one in
another directory by specifying the right path to its socket.)
<p>

Since this is a painful thing to type every time you want to debug, we
recommend you create a shortcut for it. Put the following in a file
called <tt>.gdbinit</tt> in the same directory you're working in.
(gdb runs this file when you start it up.)
<pre>
	define db
	target remote unix:.sockets/gdb
	end
</pre>
Then you can connect up to System/161 for debugging just by running
gdb and typing "db".
<p>

If you give System/161 the <em>-w</em> option, it will stop and wait
for a debugger connection before it runs anything at all. This allows
you to start debugging from the very beginning of kernel initialization.
<p>

Theoretically everything you can do with gdb normally should work with
gdb connected this way. In practice, there are probably some problems.
Bring them to the attention of the course staff and we'll see if we
can get them fixed.
<p>

When System/161 is running, if you type ^G (control-G) into its
window, it will immediately stop in gdb (if gdb is attached) or wait
for a gdb connection (if gdb is not attached).
<p>

<hr>
<A NAME=hub>

<h3>Network Connectivity with <tt>hub161</tt></h3>

If you are using the <A HREF=devices.html#nic>network card</A>, you
need to use the <tt>hub161</tt> program to provide a simulated network
for the card to plug into.
<p>

When you run <tt>hub161</tt>, you can optionally give it, on its
command line, the name of a unix-domain socket to listen to. The
default is <tt>.sockets/hub</tt>. This pathname may then be specified
in the <tt>sys161.conf</tt> file(s) of the system(s) that wish to
connect to that hub.
<p>

Each socket can only have one hub running on it at a time; however,
you can have as many hubs as you like at once by giving them different
socket names.
<p>

If you give the cards plugged into the same hub duplicate hardware
addresses, bizarre things will happen.
<p>

No facility is provided for gatewaying <tt>hub161</tt> packets onto
the real network via the host system. Such a facility could be
written, albeit with some difficulty, but will be fairly useless
unless the operating system running within System/161 contains its own
complete TCP/IP implementation.
<p>

The simulated network is a very simple link layer. All packets are
sent to the hub process, which rebroadcasts them to all network cards.
There is very little attempt at realism in general.
<p>

There is no effort made to synchronize the time among multiple
instances of System/161 connected to the same hub; thus, packets may
appear to travel in time. Furthermore, because of the way System/161
handles time, any attempt to synchronize the time in software is
likely doomed to failure.
<p>

Because <tt>hub161</tt> communicates over unix-domain sockets, it and
all the instances of <tt>sys161</tt> or <tt>trace161</tt> that wish to
connect to it must be run on the same host.
<p>

It should not be necessary to restart <tt>hub161</tt> if any of the
<tt>sys161</tt> processes attached to it die, or vice-versa either,
although a delay of up to a few seconds on a busy host system may
occur. 
<p>

If you are not using the network, it is recommended that you comment
the network devices out of <tt>sys161.conf</tt> to reduce overhead on
the host system.
<p>

<A NAME=prog>

<h3>System/161 Programming Information</h3>

At present, System/161 can be compiled to simulate only one fully
supported processor type: the MIPS r2000/r3000. There is partial
support for the Ant-32 processor as well, but this is incomplete and
not supported. It may not be present in the release tarfiles.
<p>

This page does not document MIPS r2000/r3000 programming. 
<!-- XXX we should have some links if there are any good ones. -->
<p>

The system bus used in System/161 is a simplified architecture made up
for the purpose; it is fittingly called LAMEbus. There are also a half
dozen or so simulated devices available.
<p>

<blockquote>
<A HREF=lamebus.html>LAMEbus programming info</A><br>
<A HREF=devices.html>System/161 LAMEbus devices</A><br>
</blockquote>
<p>

The kernel loaded by System/161 is (at present) loaded by the
simulator, not a boot ROM within the simulator. Thus, at present, any
of the memory regions described as being boot ROMs are in fact
unmapped and accesses to them will cause bus errors.
<p>

The kernel will be loaded into physical memory at an address chosen so
that it appears in kernel virtual memory at the virtual address it was
linked to be run at. (The desired address should be passed to the
linker at kernel build time.) Precisely what this means depends on the
processor and MMU in use. See the processor-specific pages listed at
the top of the <A HREF=lamebus.html>LAMEbus programming</A> page.
<p>

Control will be transferred to the entry point of the kernel specified
in the ELF file. The entry point will be called as if it were a C
function taking one argument: a string. This string contains the
kernel arguments passed on the System/161 command line, concatenated
with spaces.
<p>

Both the argument string and a small bootup stack, and possibly other
machine-dependent data, are located in the top few pages of physical
memory. The precise location is not specified and should not be
assumed. The kernel should establish its own stack, copy the string
to a known location elsewhere, and handle any other machine-dependent
data appropriately; then it can reuse the top of physical memory for
its own purposes.
